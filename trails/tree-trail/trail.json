  "cemeteryDescription": "**Fulham Cemetery** was established in 1865 and is the oldest of the parish's cemeteries. It was designed by the eminent Victorian architect Sir Arthur Blomfield (1829-1899), son of the Bishop of London. The burial ground was extended in 1874 and 1880.\n\n**Fulham Cemetery Friends** Fulham Cemetery Friends was set up in 2024 by local residents to help care for Fulham Cemetery â its memorials, trees, and wildlife. We aim to improve biodiversity in the cemetery and educate the public about the cemeteryâs history and ecology.",
